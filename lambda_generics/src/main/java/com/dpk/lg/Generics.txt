Problems with Generics:

1. Generics cannot be used in Overloading
2. Generics cannot be used with instanceOf
3. because of Generics we might end up havinf more space.
int[] takes very less space than Integer[].
each int takes only 4 bytes but Integer takes around 32 bytes (8x fatter)

hence List<Integer> will always takes more space.
So in java 10, it may come with a List<int>. awesome !
