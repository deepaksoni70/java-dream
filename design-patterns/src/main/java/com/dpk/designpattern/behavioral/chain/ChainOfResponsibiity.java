/**
 * <pre>
 * This class demonstrate the Chain of Responsibility pattern, In this pattern
 * we follow the if else type of request handling. If first handler is not able
 * to handle the request, it will pass on to second one, if second is also not
 * able to handle the request, then it will pass it to third one and so on.
 *
 * Example Below will approve the expense based on the the amount. 1. If amount
 * is less than 1000, clerk can approve it. 2. If amount is less than 10000,
 * manager will approve it. 3. If amount is less than 100000, CFO will approve
 * it. 4. All other will be approved by CEO.
